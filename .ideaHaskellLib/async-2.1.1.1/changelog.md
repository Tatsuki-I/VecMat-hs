 - Make 'cancelWith' wait for the cancelled thread to terminate, like 'cancel'
 - Updates to dependency bounds for GHC 8.2

## Changes in 2.1.1:

 - Add `concurrently_`
 - Add `replicateConcurrently`
 - Add `replicateConcurrently_`
 - Fix incorrect argument order in `forConcurrently_`
 - Generalize `mapConcurrently_` and `forConcurrently_` to `Foldable`
